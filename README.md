**Steps to run the web portal on localhost:**
> 1. Extract the zip file
> 2. You will be able to see 3 files named as index.html, style.css, main.js
> 3. Open the index.html file with your web browser (We tried on google chrome)
> 4. If everything goes well, you will be able to see the webpage
> 5. Here is a look of the website –

> 6. Now, you can select any of the algorithms available in the web portal
> 7. You have to give input as Burst Time in all algorithms, along with input of Priorities in case of Priority scheduling
> 8. Then you will be able to see the output in the table of Response time, waiting time, turnaround time, along with the average of waiting time and turnaround time

**Existing bugs –**
>	When you first open the website or reload it, the css of the delete row button is quite badly arranged
>	To deal with this, you simply need to select any one of the algorithms apart from the FCFS, and then it will work absolutely fine without any errors.
